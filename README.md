# WebSocket Lab

WebSocket Lab is a straightforward tool for running a WebSocket server when you need to test WebSocket clients. Think of it like a [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for WebSocket that you run locally.

## Usage

Start the WebSocket server on port 8181 with this command:

```bash
npx websocket-lab
```

That's it! Your WebSocket server is up and running. Test your WebSocket clients hassle-free.

> [!NOTE]
> To use WebSocket Lab, you must have Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download and install it from https://nodejs.org/.
